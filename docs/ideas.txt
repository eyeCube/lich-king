DO NOT encumber player based on what is being carried in inventory
	give them a magic bag of holding that stores all that shit.
	
Stats and what they do:
	speed
		increases speed of movement
	jump
		a little bit of extra jump makes a huge change.
			Should therefore become exponentially more difficult to acquire.
		not likely to be altered very much during gameplay except by gear / spells
			maybe you can only gain 2 jump (total of 3.5) at most through normal means, but with gear and spells you can achieve much higher like values of 5, 6, etc. Could go crazy like Morrowind w/ rare Icarian flight spell.
	acceleration - not likely to be altered during gameplay
	life max - obvious
	mana max
		mana is needed and is consumed when casting spells.
	stamina max
		stamina is needed to attack and cast spells and is consumed when doing so.
		It is consumed when running, jumping, ...
		Ratio of stamina : maximum affects your ability to do any task!
		It regenerates over time rapidly, as a proportion of maximum (e.g. 20% / second)
	strength
		increases power of all physical attacks
	wisdom
		increases power of all spells
	pow_fire, etc.
		increases the power of fire (or w/e element) spells.
	res_...
		damage = damage * 100/resistance

Enchanting
	To get elemental damage on a weapon (called enchanting), you have to
		expend Mana. This can be for a duration or quasi-permanent where you
		sacrifice a portion of your max mana pool and give it to the weapon.
		Of course you have to have the enchanting spell (fire enchant, etc.)
